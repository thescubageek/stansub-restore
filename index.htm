<p align="center"><font face="Tahoma"><b><font size="4">Welcome to my Website!&nbsp;</font></b> Here you will find 
information on the only gliding submarine ever built, and the world's deepest 
diving submersible to offer rides to the general public. The first submersible 
is named C-BUG- an acronym for Controlled by Buoyancy Underwater Glider. This 
sub took eight years to build as I was young, in school, and somewhat 
underfinanced at the time. It made it's first dives in May of 1997 and has made 
over 550 dives in 3 countries since.&nbsp;For two years it operated in Roatan 
Honduras, exploring the depths of the Cayman Trench. Children as young as 6 and 
senior citizens as old as 84 have been able to explore uncharted waters with me, 
traveling deeper and seeing things unthinkable to even professionally trained 
divers. Taking the lessons learned from this operation I decided to build a new 
submersible, since named the Idabel, after the town where it was built in 
Oklahoma.&nbsp; It is now operating in the same location as C-BUG, at Half Moon Bay 
Cabins, Roatan, Honduras.&nbsp; This submersible is not only &quot;bigger and better&quot; than 
C-BUG, but represents the first time in history a deep submersible has been 
designed for one specific dive location. It is also the first time a deep 
submersible has been constructed of three variable sized spheres, and is the 
deepest sub ever constructed by a private individual. I cannot say I did it all 
my own however, many individuals and businesses contributed, both in Oklahoma, 
and in fact from all over the world.</font></td></tr><tr>

<a NAME="top"><font face="Tahoma">
<p style="text-align: center">Many ride options are offered for those seeking 
journeys to &quot;inner space&quot;. There is a shipwreck at 2600 feet to explore, a 
seamount raising over 2000 feet like a castle spire, a night dive option, and 
even an option where a couple can join the &quot;half mile down club&quot;.&nbsp; The most 
common option though is a 1200 foot deep dive that lasts an hour and 15 minutes. 
Pricing is not per person, but per trip, with a 550 pound weight allowance.&nbsp; 
Prices start at $500 for the trip. Passengers are encouraged to bring warm 
clothes if desiring to go on any of the deeper dives, and any music they may like 
to hear on their journey, as the vehicle has a built in CD player. With the 
commencement of dives by Idabel, new ground is being broken for tourist 
submersibles. The only other sub to offer rides to the public is in the Cayman 
Islands and stops at 1000' and charges $450 PER PERSON for a 50 minute dive.&nbsp; 
One's only other option for getting this deep (and back up again) is to charter 
a research sub with tender boat, which starts at $8,000 a day).</p>
<p style="text-align: center">In addition to operating this submarine, I am available to consult people interested in building a submarine
of their own. I adhere to a philosophy that no two people should ever have the same submersible.  To 
maximize use of one's submarine and keep it from joining the many that sit in storage, it needs to be 
designed as specifically for it's intended use as possible.</p>
