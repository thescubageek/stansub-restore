The pressure hull is now complete. I am installing the motors and high-pressure flasks. Soon I will
start on the electronics. Note the stick over the sub. This indacates top of deck in forward ballast
compartment. The large forward view shows the dome viewport which is 30 inches in diameter.</p>

After a six month treasure salvage job, I finally made a firm comitment to build a second submersible. 
In preparation for this I drove across the country and back taking over six months to meet withy those 
knowledgable in the field, attend trade shows, and gather parts. I also decided on a location to build 
the new sub, based on the recomendation of businessman Buck Hill, whom I met on Roatan.  Idabel OK was 
chosen for it's low cost of living, local support/ interest in the project, and abundance of machine 
shops and steel suppliers in the area and a nearby deep lake suitable for testing.  Since April I have 
been living here and working to make the new submarine come to life.</p>

<p>Like C-BUG, my new sub (to be named Idabel in reconigition of the eutusiasm of local residents for 
the project) will be innovative in many ways.  Idabel is made up of three spheres, of three different 
sizes jioned in an L. The pilot stands in the 2 smaller ones and the third houses two passengers who 
this time get the foward view via a 30 inch diameter domed and 19 inch diameter flat viewports.</p>

<p>Idabel also reprents the first time in history a deep submersible (design depth > 1/2 mile) is being 
custom designed for one specific dive location.  This is evident by such features as upwards looking 
viewports to take in the spectacular views looking up the wall, twin propulsion systems for redundancy 
while operating automously and battery capacity sufficent to reach the wreck of the cargo ship RV Wendy
, sunk 1.6 miles from my base of operations, again Half Moon Bay Cabins.</p>
<p>Like C-BUG it is highly engineered to reduce displacement, however this time a greater premium was 
put on passenger space as refected by gross vechicle weight jumping to 7,000 lbs for 3 people vs. 2400 
lbs for C-BUGS's 2 people.  (still highly compact when compared to say Alvin that also carries 3 people 
but weighs 32,000 pounds).</p>
<p>By the end of this month the pressure hull will be complete and I will start outfitting it with the 
different systems (electrical, life support, ballast etc.) for which over 90% of the components are 
allready on hand. Estimated launch date is May 2003- with resumption of tourist dives in Roatan that 
summer.  One thousand, 200 foot dives will be the base dive, with the wreck, 2,500 and night dives as 
options.  Please consider coming to Roatan and joining me on a trip exploring inner-space!</p>

and next month's Scuba Diving.</p>
