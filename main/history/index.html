<font size=2 face="Arial, Helvetica"><p>Ever since I was a child I knew I was going to build submarines.&nbsp; I decided 
after reading a book in the third grade.&nbsp; Years of research followed, untill , at the age 
of 15 , I bought my first piece of steel.&nbsp; In between attending college, and learning much 
as I went along, it took eight years to complete.&nbsp; (If done full- time, a sub can be built 
in aboout a year.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I choose to make my sub a gliding sub for two important reasons.&nbsp; 
One is that by not needing a large bank of batteries to power the motors,&nbsp; the craft can 
wiegh a great deal less, making it much easier to transport, and therefore less expensive 
to use.&nbsp; Second is that by keeping it non-motorized, and being a boat only 12 feet long, 
it is legally the same as a canoe in the eyes of the law.&nbsp; This means it does not even have 
to be registered.&nbsp; The CBUG allows two people at a time to glide down to up to 700 feet deep, 
and stay as long as they'd like.&nbsp; All with no decompression.&nbsp; While other subs do exsist with 
similar capabilities, they cost thousands of dollars a day to operate, not hundreds, like the 
CBUG.&nbsp; Recentely small motors have been added to help with steering amoung the near verticle 
walls off Roatan.</p>
<p>This location has proven to be heaven to operate a sub in.  Once the sub has passed through the first
thermo-cline, the visibility averages 300 feet and can exceed 500 feet, due to the lack of mixing with 
the sediment rich waters above.  Needless to say this is spectacular in itself.  Visualize being next
to a vertical and in places, overhanging, wall of solic rock that has been dissolved into amazing 
shapes.  This wall has many canyons, cracks, caves and other interesting features to explore.  Now add 
to the equation animals that are unique to these depths and hardly ever seen.  At least one new
species has already been discovered, a variety of Big-eye fish, that lives in a single isolated colony 
below 400 feet.</p>
<p>  Since the C-BUG operates at the edge of the Cayman Trench (max depth &gt;20,000 feet)
it is a short trip for open water species to check out the sub.  Leatherback sea turtles, hammerhead 
and bull sharks, schools of 1000's of tuna, and a variety of other schooling fish have all been 
observed from the sub.  On occasion the C-BUG has dived in the night, sometimes with food attached
to it to attract even more bizarre animals.  Pelagic tunicates, squid, foot-long corkscrew worms,
an animal that had wings like a stingray but was clear like a jellyfish and of course a variety of 
sharks have been seen on night dives.</p>
<p>  The C-BUG has also found and retrieved a sunken boat.  A 
modern 27 footer, all out of fiberglass, was brought up from 365 feet.  Restored, with a new engine
and appropriately named &quot;Resurrected&quot;, it now serves as a tender to the sub that salvaged her.  What's 
next for the C-BUG?  Numerous people have expressed interest in using it for treasure hunting.  Many
others might charter it for scientific research.
