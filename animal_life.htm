Though sunlight will penetrate to depths of 2000 feet, it is not intense enough past 300 feet for any sort of plant, except one type of red algae. Thus, while on land or in shallow water, all things can be classified as plant, animal, or mineral, where we venture, one of these categories has been eliminated.</P><P>The animals at these depths have undergone many strange adaptations. Some are blood red, as red light is the shortest wave length of light and totally absorbed inthese waters. Others are translucent or shiny like a mirror. Still others make their own light and, not only fish and invertebrates, but even corals and whole sponges can glow.</P>
      <P>And others give us a rare glimpse back in time. For example, the Sea 
        Lillie, spotted on each dive but only surviving below 500 feet, have remained 
        unchanged in their stable environment for some 230 million years (over 
        half the time that there has been life on the planet).</P>
      <P>At 1800 feet, light fades to perpetual darkness, the water temperature 
        drops to a few degrees above freezing, and the truly strange animals take 
        over. Fish are just as likely to stand on their heads or point straight 
        up as they are to swim. Sharks with no dorsal fins grow to 20 feet. Tripod 
        fish, polka-dotted angler fish, and swimming sea cucumbers start to appear. 
        On almost every dive, something is encountered that is new to the pilot, 
        many of which cannot be identified in any books.</P>
