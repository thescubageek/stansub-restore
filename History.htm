<font face="Tahoma"><p><span style="vertical-align: super">I made up my mind to 
build subs when I was 9 years old.&nbsp; After years of research I bought my first 
piece of steel at age 15. In between after school jobs and classes I worked on 
this vehicle, until 8 years later, the same week I graduated college, it made 
it's first dive.&nbsp; Soon after I moved to Ft. Lauderdale Florida to be close to 
the clear, deep waters of the gulf stream and made approximately 50 dives. This 
was done by trading dives to those willing to tow me the many miles offshore to 
get to deep enough water. In Sept. of 98' I had my sub on display at Neal 
Watson's &quot;Ocean Fest&quot; and met the owners of a dive resort on Roatan, Honduras. 
Two months later I moved.</span></p>
<p><span style="vertical-align: super">This location has proven to be heaven to operate a sub in.  Once the sub has passed through the first
thermo-cline, the visibility averages 300 feet and can exceed 500 feet, due to the lack of mixing with 
the sediment rich waters above.  Needless to say this is spectacular in itself.  Visualize being next
to a vertical and in places, overhanging, wall of solid rock that has been dissolved into amazing 
shapes.  This wall has many canyons, cracks, caves and other interesting features to explore.  Now add 
to the equation animals that are unique to these depths and hardly ever seen.  At least one new
species has already been discovered, a variety of Big-eye fish, that lives in a single isolated colony 
below 400 feet.</span></p>
<p>  <span style="vertical-align: super">Since I operate at the edge of the 
Cayman Trench (max depth &gt;20,000 feet) it is a short trip for open water species 
to check out the sub. Leatherback sea turtles, hammerhead and bull sharks, 
schools of 1000's of tuna, and a variety of other schooling fish have all been 
observed from the sub. On occasion I have dove in the night, sometimes with food 
attached to attract even more bizarre animals. Pelagic tunicates, squid, 
foot-long corkscrew worms, an animal that had wings like a stingray but was 
clear like a jellyfish and of course a variety of sharks have been seen on night 
dives.</span></p>
